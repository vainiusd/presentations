Presenting
------
* Impress.js sometimes hangs on start and puts view just bellow title slide. Use arrows in bottom right corner to move to second slide and then back to title slide.
Everything works after that.
* Run on Firefox 69 and MS Edge. 
* MS Edge is sensitive to shellinabox untrusted certificate CA in iframe.
